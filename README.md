## Introduction

This repository contains an example of a preprocesing service. A preprocessing service reads the Package Leaflet of an ePI, and adds semmantic annotations to it.

---
## Kubernetes Deployment

1. Create the following resources:
```bash
kubectl apply -f kubernetes-yaml/001_preprocessing-service-example-service.yaml
kubectl apply -f kubernetes-yaml/002_preprocessing-service-example-deployment.yaml
```

In order to be discovered by the focusing manager, the service.yaml needs to include the following selector in the `spec` field:

```yaml
metadata:
  labels:
    eu.gravitate-health.fosps.preprocessing: "true"
```

NOTE: This service does not need to be published to the internet, so no gateway config is needed to proxy any petition. This is an internal service.

---
## Usage

Service will be accessible internally from the kubernetes cluster with the url `http://preprocessing-service-example.default.svc.cluster.local:3000/preprocess`
